# simple_assembly_compiler
In this project your job is to design a program with your chosen programming language that reads a text file containing assembly code as input and writes the result of registers and flags in another text file as output.
In order to reduce complexity:
• Only 5 instructions need to be implemented. (And, Or, Sub, Add & Mov)
• There is no need of data segment.
• Registers are: (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX), note: “Your design should be able to
understand the smaller registers of these registers.”
• Flags are: (Carry, Zero, Negative & Overflow)
